            <h2>Why Pursue a Certificate</h2>
            <h3>in International Bible Academy?</h3>
            <h4>1. Enjoy the Flexibility of a Fully Online and Time Efficient program</h4>
            <p>You can pursue this fully online program at you own pace and elect to take its online classes.</p>
            <h4>2. All the courses are free.</h4>
            <p>For one, we make the cost of operations as efficient as possible. Classes focus more on what’s being taught rather than the classroom itself, staff members share offices, and the faculty teach moved by our vision more than a salary.
                But, free tuition actually does come at a price—in the form of countless prayers and dedicated sacrifice, from people who also believe that learning about God should come free-of-cost.</p>
                <h4>3. Receive deeper lessons about God and His Word and gain knowledge.</h4>
            <p>Dive into the Old and New Testaments, including each book’s history, era, purpose and background. Understand the basics of how to interpret and study the Scriptures correctly. Examine the central doctrines of the Christian faith—from the theology of God to Eschatology to the afterlife.</p>
